Install Redis
The first step is to get Redis up and running locally on your machine. The simplest way to install Redis is via the operating systemâ€™s package manager like so:


```
1.sudo apt-get install redis-server
```

To check if the redis server is running, issue the following command on the terminal:

```
1.$ sudo redis-server
2.* Ready to accept connections
```

To test load
Installing loadtest as root is simple:

```
1.sudo npm install -g loadtest
```

```
$ loadtest -n 100 -k  http://localhost:8000/store/

 loadtest -n 100 -k  http://localhost:8000/store/
